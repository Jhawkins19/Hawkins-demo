  <h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
  <p> Hi, I'm Jasmine this is my first webpage </p>
  <p>I'm from Hyde Park but lived on the East Coast in the Maryland area for years.</p>
  <p>I really like Graphic Design but I want to learn Web development and gain more coding knowledge</p>
  <p>In my free time I enjoy sketching, going on photography adventures and reading inspirational books.</p>
